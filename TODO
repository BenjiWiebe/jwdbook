make script check if the print checkbox is selected, it shouldn't be!!

	looks like ahk cant detect the tab directly. we could make sure farmbooks is full screen(maybe??) and then click at the right pixel offsets. EDIT I think it can detect it automatically

before marking a tx batch as entered, we could ask the user if everything was ok and then only mark them if it was

which file has the LATEST AND BEST CODE: loanacct_withdrawals.rb
