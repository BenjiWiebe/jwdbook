make scripts warn that you need to be in the correct tab (Checks, Deposits) and also have no data already entered (i.e. cursor in the date field)

before marking a tx batch as entered, we could ask the user if everything was ok and then only mark them if it was

which file has the LATEST AND BEST CODE: loanacct_withdrawals.rb
